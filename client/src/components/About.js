        <p className="text">Our mission is to keep our city clean. Volunteer for clean up projects near you that your fellow city goers have posted.
            <br/>
            Our forests, rivers, oceans and soils provide us with the food we eat, the air we breathe, the water we irrigate our crops with. 
            We also rely on them for numerous other goods and services we depend on for our health, happiness and prosperity. These natural assets are often called the world's 'natural capital'.
            <br/>
